    <h2>WHY I LOVE YOU?</h2>

    <p>Girl, you are the woman of my dreams. I never saw you as my girlfriend. You were always my life partner
        I have never seen a better person in my life before. You are my greatest supporter. You always keep me in your prayers
        You are beautiful. You are astonishing. You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. You motivate me to work hard for you.
        You are always thinking the best for me. Girl, I'm obsessed with you. People fall for beauty. I fell for your personality.
        I love you so much. I always want you in my life. You are my wife. I want to see you in the red dress. Your hugs are my medicide, your kisses are my cure.
        I love you.
